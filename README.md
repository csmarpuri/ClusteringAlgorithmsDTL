# SummerResearch2016

This document details the major changes that were made to the resposistory as cloned from:
https://github.com/alex-ozdemir/phylogenetic-reconciliation


##  Added

* `nnic` 
A directory that contains code to test the NNI Conjecture.

* `phylogenetic/run_experiments/`
This directory contains bash scripts to run the k centers, k medoids (from random, from point collect), data from the run, and output (including crash data). 

* `phylogenetic/run_experiments/processed_data`
This directory contains scripts to format the data that comes back from running the experiments into CSV for google sheets to plot histograms. 

* `phylogenetic/cluster/cluster_debug`
This directory contains scripts and result files that are used to calculated the number of reconciliations for files in the TreeLifeData/ and verify that the new version of KMeans.py the DP.py work (produce frequencies that are less than 1). Use `verify_graphs.py` to check for the frequency likelihood that is more than 1.  

* `phylogenetic/cluster/k_centers.py`, `phylogenetic/cluster/k_medoids_pointcollect.py`, `phylogenetic/cluster/k_medoids_random.py`
These files replace the original `FromNewick.py` file that was here, which created reconciliation graphs and calculcated reconciliation counts. The k centers algorithm as described in the paper (Summer 2016 in Share LaTex). Run as `python pythonFile newickFile maxK`. 

* `phylogenetic/cluster/KMeans.py`
Implemented a function `get_weighted_template()` that returns a randomly chosen node that is weighted by frequency as opposed to true random choice. Used in `phylogenetic/cluster/k_centers.py`, `phylogenetic/cluster/k_medoids_pointcollect.py`, `phylogenetic/cluster/k_medoids_random.py`

* `phylogenetic/cluster/calc_recon.py`
Create cache files for graphs and reconciliation counts for the files in `TreeLifeData/` directory. 



## Changed

* `phylogenetic/DP.py`
The way that the preorder check was done is updated to check for same map nodes across different depth levels -- preorderCheck(preOrderList). Minor formatting (naming) and readability refactoring in addScores(treeMin, DTLDict, ScoreDict), no functional changes.

* `phylogenetic/cluster/cache` 
More reconciliation graphs constructed during experiment running. Also, added a corresponding set of `.count` files that hold the associated number of reconciliations. 


## Not Changed
* `phylogenetic/*`
* `phylogenetic/TreeLifeData/`
* `phylogenetic/newickData/`
* `phylogenetic/rasmus/`
* `phylogenetic/static/`
* `phylogenetic/templates/`
* `phylogenetic/updateFiles/`
* `phylogenetic/xscape/`
* `phylogenetic/Vidua/`
* `phylogenetic/compbio/`
* `phylogenetic/onlineFolder/`
* `phylogenetic/svgFiles/`
* `phylogenetic/testFiles/`
* `phylogenetic/uploadFolder/`
