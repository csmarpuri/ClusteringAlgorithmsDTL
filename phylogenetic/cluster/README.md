There are 2 types of output: debugging/informational and results. 



### K centers debugging 
The debugging output contains information about which file was run, whether the DictGraph and the reconCount had to be generated or was loaded from the cache, and results from checking whether the likelihood in the DictGraph structure was more than 1 (it shouldn't be) -- the check rounds the value to account for float errors.

#### K centers results 
The results output contains the file name for the file that was run, and for `n` rows for each value of `k` including the value given for `max_k`. For each row, the first number is k value, the second number is ending average cluster radius, and the third number is the starting average radius. The second number should be smaller than/equal to the third number (with exception as noted in the Known Issues section in the main README).

### K Medoids from Point Collect, K Medoids rom random debugging 
The debugging output is very similar to the k centers debugging output. Here, additional informaiton is printed about each iterattion, and an early exit after `n` iterations indicates that the point collecting algorithm converged. The only difference is that the k medoids from point collect has one run per `k` value, whereas the

### K Medoids from Point Collect results 
The results output contains the file name for the file that was run, and for `n` rows for each value of `k` including the value given for `max_k`. For each row, the first number is k value, the second number is ending average cluster radius, and the third number is the starting average radius. The fourth number is the result from taking the best from random. This allows for comparison from end/start (normalized) and end/random which gives you an idea of how good point collecting is over random. The second number should be larger than/equal to the third number (with exception as noted in the Known Issues section in the main README).

The second number should be smaller than/equal to the third number (with exception as noted in the Known Issues section in the main README). There should be `x` rows of sets of `max_k` rows, as `x` is set in `for seed in xrange(x):` in the k medoids python file. The default is 5.

### All algorithms

* If instead for debugging, you get:

```
Too few reconciliations:  6.0
```

This means that the newick file found that the number of optimal reconciliations was below the threshold as set in the python file. This usually means that there is not a meaningful number of optimal options to choose from. It's default is 100, that was the threshold as used in the paper. 


* If you do not get a full output in the results (i.e. if you set `max_k=4` and there are only 3 lines), check the debug output -- there was likely a memory error or crash.
