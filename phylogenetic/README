README HOW TO RUN EXPERIMENTS
#############################

To run a file, enter into the comand line
python MasterReconciliation.py "newick FileName" duplicationCost TransferCost LosssCost "frequency type" switchLo switchHi lossLo lossHi

Our experiments were run in this matter over a directory of some 4,000-odd newick files, with
D = 2
T = 3
L = 1
switchLo = 1.5
switchHi = 4.5
lossLo = 1
lossHi = 3

freqType is a string that represents what scoring function is used.
It can be "frequency" "unit" or "xscape".

User needs the following python modules installed on their machine in order to 
utilise this software.

BioPython
MatPlotLib
Shapely

program will create several files inluding one .tree file and any number of .stree and .brecon files to represent the gene tree, species trees, and reconciliations respectively.

To render the reconciliations, enter into the comand line:
python vistrans.py -t "fileName.tree" -s "fileName.stree" -b "fileName.brecon"

the result will be a .svg file viewable in a web browser
